I am lead developer of a project called *Gammapy*. Gammapy is an open source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy. It supports the analyis of data from Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, such as [CTA](https://www.cta-observatory.org), [H.E.S.S.](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/)
[MAGIC](https://magic.mpp.mpg.de/) and [VERITAS](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/), but it also 
also allows users to combined data from mutiple instruments to improve their results.

The project was started by my PhD supervisor [Christoph Deil](https://christophdeil.com) almost a decade ago. Since then the project has accumulated >100 users in the gamma-ray community and is expected to grow further. In 2020 the project has been selected as the base library for the official Science Tools of the [Cherenkov Telescope Array](https://www.cta-observatory.org). In 2022 the software was awarded the [Jury Prize of the Open Science Awards](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/open-science-free-software-award-ceremony/) at the Open Science European Conference in Paris. In 2022 we released the first long term support (LTS) version v1.0.

*Pylira* is a Python package for deconvolution of astronomical images in the presence of Poisson noise.
It based on the 
MCMC sampling Hierarchical multiscale prior. Allows users to uncertainties.
It is mostly a wrapper around a R package. It uses *pybind11*.
