> **How I use AI for this Webpage:** In times of AI I would like to add a little transparency on 
> how and where I use AI to create content for this webpage. All texts on this webpage are written
> by myself. As this is a personal webpage, this is exactly how I want it to be, no need for 
> efficiency, but all about authenticity. I use AI to maintain and code the infrastructure of the webpage,
> and I use AI for code examples in the blog posts. Otherwise I use AI for fixing typos and 
> sometimes review texts, before I send them to human reviewers.
