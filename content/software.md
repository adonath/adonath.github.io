I am lead developer of a project called *Gammapy*. *Gammapy* is an **open source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy**. It supports the analyis of data from Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, such as [CTA](https://www.cta-observatory.org), [H.E.S.S.](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/)
[MAGIC](https://magic.mpp.mpg.de/) and [VERITAS](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/), but also from all-sky instruments such as [Fermi-LAT](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and [HAWC](https://www.hawc-observatory.org/). It also allows users to combine data from all those
instruments to improve their scientific results.

The project was started by my PhD supervisor [Christoph Deil](https://christophdeil.com) almost a decade ago. Since then *Gammapy* has accumulated >100 users in the gamma-ray astronomy community and is expected to grow further. In 2020 the project has been selected as the base library for the official Science Tools of the [Cherenkov Telescope Array](https://www.cta-observatory.org). In February 2022 the software was awarded the [Jury Prize of the Open Science Awards](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/open-science-free-software-award-ceremony/) at the Open Science European Conference in Paris. In November 2022 we released the first long term support (LTS) version v1.0.

*Pylira* is a Python package for deconvolution of astronomical images in the presence of Poisson noise.

MCMC sampling Hierarchical multiscale prior. Allows users to uncertainties.
It is mostly a wrapper around a R package. It uses *pybind11*.

_________________________
I have contributed to other astronomical open source software projects, such as [*Astropy*](https://astropy.org), where I am also one of the sub-package maintainers for *astropy.convolution*.
I have made multiple minor contributions to *Astropy* affiliated packages such as [*photutils*](https://github.com/astropy/photutils), [*regions*](https://github.com/astropy/regions) and [*hipspy*](https://github.com/hipspy/hips). I wrote the [initial prototype](https://github.com/adonath/blob_detection) for *Scikit-imageâ€™s* [blob detection functionality](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_blob.html).

I also contributed to [*gamma-cat*](https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat), an open source data collection for gamma-ray astronomy.
