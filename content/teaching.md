## Astronomy Software Tutorials
__________________________
In the past I have given tutorials on the usage of some of the software I co-developed. Some of them you can find below:

This tutorial is aimed at beginners to the field of gamma-ray astronomy. The tutorial was given as part of the [ESCAPE summer school 2021](https://escape2020.github.io/school2021/). 
It uses the [Gammapy](https://gammapy.org) package to demonstrate the analysis of data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). It covers the basics of gamma-ray
data analysis, including creating and filtering of event lists, image and spectral analysis of binned counts data, model fitting and computation of significance maps and flux points.

A beginner tutorial on the usage of the [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org) package. The tutorial was given as part of the [ESCAPE summer school 2021](https://escape2020.github.io/school2021/).
It covers the basics of the Astropy package, including coordinate and time handling and conversion, quantities and units, table data structures and FITS serialization as well as coordinate
aware plotting and visualization of astronomical images.
