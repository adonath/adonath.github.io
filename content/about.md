I am a Postdoc researcher at the [Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu) in Cambridge MA, where I research in the field of X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy. Previously (until 2020) I have worked at the [Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/de/) in Heidelberg, where I also did my PhD.


- I am interested in the global structure of the Milky-Way in GeV-TeV gamma-rays and the Galactic gamma-ray source population. This includes association and classification of TeV gamma-ray sources in context of source catalog production as well as separation of sources from interstellar diffuse gamma-ray emission.

- My second interest is in advanced data analysis methods for counts based data with low statistics. This includes maximum likelihood based spectro-morphological modelling of gamma-ray data, with handling of time and spatially dependent instrument response and combining data from multiple gamma-ray instruments.

- I am also interested in open source software development and reproducible, open science.
