Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a Posdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu) in Cambridge, MA.
I develop new statistical methods and scientific open source software for the analysis
of astronomical low counts data. I apply those methods to better understand the Galactic
X-Ray and Gamma-Ray source populations.

I'm also interested in developing new methods and open data formats to combine data
from multiple instruments, such as the
[Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO)](https://www.cta-observatory.org),
[H.E.S.S.](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/), [HAWC](https://www.hawc-observatory.org)
and [Fermi-LAT](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov) but also X-ray observatories such as
[Chandra](https://chandra.harvard.edu). By advocating openness I hope to
facilitate collaboration between astronomical observatories for better,
more open and reproducible science.

I'm the lead developer of the open source software package [Gammapy](https://gammapy.org),
sub-package maintainer of [Astropy](https://astropy.org) and a member of the
[CHASC astro-statistics collaboration](https://hea-www.harvard.edu/astrostat/).
I'm also editor for the Astronomy and Astrophysics track of the Journal of Open Source Software [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org).
