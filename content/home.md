I'm a Postdoc researcher at the [Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu).
I work on statistical methods for analysis of low counts astronomical data.

My research interests include the Galactic X-Ray and Gamma-Ray source populations
as well as statistical methods for analysis of low counts data in general.
I'm is also interested in methods to combine data from multiple instruments.
I'm the lead developer of the open source software package [Gammapy](https://gammapy.org),
sub-package maintainer of [Astropy](https://astropy.org) and a member of the
[CHASC astro-statistics collaboration](https://hea-www.harvard.edu/astrostat/).
I'm also editor for the Astronomy and Astrophysics track of [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org).
